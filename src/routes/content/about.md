title: About
---

I am a full-stack engineer for the web, games, and apps. I have 15 years of professional experience and have been tinkering with code for much, much longer. Since 2015, I've been the Lead Developer at the [Engagement Lab](https://elab.emerson.edu) with previous stints at startups and a major marketing firm.

Most of my recent work centers around using games and the web to help solve problems in democracy and governance, global health, media literacy, and equity and accessibility.

I live in Boston with my wife and dog.
