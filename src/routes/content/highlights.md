      text: Beta Blocks is a scalable, flexible and re-usable platform for engaging Bostonâ€™s residents on issues of urban technology and data. I developed the website and created an audio recorder and streamer web app for its travelling exhibition. It recorded audio off any device's attached mic and uploaded the resulting buffer to MongoDB LFS for streaming at another exhibit station, with a fallback to store the buffer locally for later upload. There was also an accompanying moderation Slack bot, which sent all recorded audio to our team for review, allowing the team to listen to clips and approve them to be sent to the stream, or delete them for content reasons.

    - name: Hygiene with Chhota Bheem
      text: Mobile game component and web presence for a play-based curriculum designed to raise awareness of and encourage best practices for health and hygiene among young children. Hands spread an estimated 80% of common infectious diseases like the common cold and flu. But these disease-causing germs slide off easily with good hand washing technique. The mobile game compliments the curriculum and has the player (Chhota Bheem, from the hugely popular Indian animated comedy adventure television series) running through top-down levels to defeat various bosses and avoid obstacles. The game has been played more than 50k people.
