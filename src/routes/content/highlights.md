## Beta Blocks
![static/bb.png](bb.png)

Beta Blocks is a a scalable, flexible and re-usable platform for engaging Bostonâ€™s residents on issues of urban technology and data. I developed the website and created an audio recorder and streamer web app for its travelling exhibition. It recorded audio off any device's attached mic and uploaded the resulting buffer to MongoDB LFS for streaming at another exhibit, with a fallback to store the buffer locally for later upload. There was also an accompanying moderation Slack bot, which sent all recorded audio to our team for review, allowing the team to listen to clips and approve them to be sent to the stream, or delete them for content reasons.
